Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using this referral feature  to send an e-mail on your behalf to such designated recipients about the  particular promotion, product, or service in which you indicated your \"friend\"  may have an interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Non Personally Identifiable Information We Collect<br /></strong>In  some cases, Southwest may collect information about you that is not personally  identifiable. Examples of this type of information include, but are not limited  to the frequency of your use of this web site and the route by which you choose  to access it, and your use of any hyperlinks available on this web site. We and  our service providers or agents may process and use this data for purposes  including, but not limited to planning web site development, assessing patterns  of use, planning and assessing marketing initiatives by Southwest. This  information is gathered by certain tools and methods such as the collection of  your IP address or the use of cookies.</p>\n<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>\n<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to  administer our web sites, and for other purposes discussed in this privacy  policy. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information  except for fraud prevention.</p>\n<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>\n<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all Southwest affiliated web sites  and emails covered by this Privacy Policy. We may store certain personally  identifiable information you submit while on our web sites in persistent cookies  on your computer in an encrypted format.</p>\n<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies  to make it easier for you to navigate our web sites. A session ID cookie expires  when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for  an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following  directions provided in your Internet browser's \"help\" file.</p>\n<p>We set a persistent cookie to store certain information, including your  account number, so you don't have to enter it each time you want to log-in to  your Rapid Rewards, Southwest or SWABIZ&reg; account. Persistent cookies also enable  us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on  our site as well as provide more relevant content in our e-mails. Southwest  Airlines has agreed to allow a select group of marketing platforms to place  persistent cookies in our web sites, Southwest Airlines emails and Rapid Rewards  emails. In addition to use on our web sites, these cookies may be used for  targeted online advertising by both Southwest and third party merchants on third  party websites. These cookies do not enable a marketing platform to collect  personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p><strong>Opt-out<br /></strong>To opt-out from our marketing platform&rsquo;s  persistent cookies click here. (please note that if you delete your cookies or  switch to a different browser you will have to repeat this procedure). Use of  the cookies by the marketing platforms is subject to their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use  some areas of our site will be limited and we may not be able to provide you  with the most convenient experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Site Usage Profile<br /></strong>We store and use certain personally  identifiable information and information that we collect through cookies and log  files to create a site usage profile of your preferences. We may use this  information to provide you with targeted advertisements and offers on our web  site. In addition we may provide this information to our select marketing  platforms, and these cookies may be used for targeted online advertising by both  Southwest and third party merchants on third party websites.</p>\n<p><strong>Southwest Account, SWABIZ&reg;, and Rapid Rewards&reg;  Registration<br /></strong>You are not required to establish a Southwest account  (also referred to as a SWABIZ Traveler account for the uses of our SWABIZ web  site designed for corporate use) to use this web site, however some features of  our site are not available to unregistered users. For example, you must have a  Rapid Rewards, Southwest or SWABIZ account to save your travel preferences (such  as the type of rental car you prefer or your favorite travel routes) for future  travel arrangements made through our website, store credit card information so  that you do not need to re-enter it for future purchases, have access to special  Members-only promotions and discounts.</p>\n<p>If you would like to take advantage of the conveniences available through  special Southwest account or SWABIZ features, you must first register for a  Southwest or SWABIZ account. Additional features are available to Rapid Rewards  Members. To take advantage of those additional features, you must first enroll  in the Rapid Rewards program. During registration, you are required to provide  contact information (which may include name, address, phone number, e-mail  address, and birth date).</p>\n<p>Additionally you have the option to provide demographic information, social  media account information, and travel preferences to us; we encourage you to  submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on  our site, send you valuable offers, and otherwise better serve you online. We  may use the preferences you store in your profile to send you special targeted  e-mails based on these preferences. For example, if you express a preference for  a specific type of rental car, we may send you special offers for renting this  type of vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong>Rapid Rewards Program</strong></p>\n<p>If you do not already have a Rapid Rewards account, you can easily establish  one during the Southwest account or SWABIZ registration process. Electing to  establish a Rapid Rewards account will enroll you in the Southwest Airline  frequent flyer program and give you the opportunity to earn rewards. You will  not be able to earn points toward reward flights if you elect to not sign up for  this program. As a Rapid Rewards Member, you may also receive special offers by  e-mail simply for being a Member of the Rapid Rewards program.</p>\n<p>We may use the personally identifiable information you provide when you  become a Rapid Rewards Member for analytical, administrative, marketing,  correspondence or other operational or business purposes. For more information  on how we may use your personally identifiable information as a Rapid Rewards  Member please see our Customer Communications section below.</p>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" class=\"mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -40px; top: -25px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\"></div>"
